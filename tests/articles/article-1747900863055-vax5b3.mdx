I am trying to create a blogging library that let users store their markdown all on Github, without storing them anywhere else.

## Aftermath

After that I will let users be able to access it via a library interface so that they can render their blog in nextjs, all with free and opensource software.

## Performance issues

It seems the more I type the less performant this app becomes.&#x20;

Now let's see if this thing will be slow, I feel like it's quite slow, so I need to figure out a way to stop the whole component from rerendering, whew, what a job.

But vhim we will make it work.
