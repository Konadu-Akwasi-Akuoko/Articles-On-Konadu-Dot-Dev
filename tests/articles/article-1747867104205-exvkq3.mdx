# Markdown Guide

I am trying to create a blogging library that let users store their markdown all on Github, without storing them anywhere else.

## Aftermath

After that I will let users be able to access it via a library interface so that they can render their blog in nextjs, all with free and opensource software.

## Performance issues

It seems the more I type the less performant this app becomes.&#x20;

***I need to look into that ASAP***
